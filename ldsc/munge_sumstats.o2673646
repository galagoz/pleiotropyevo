Interpreting column names as follows:
SNPID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Z:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
EAF:	Allele frequency
