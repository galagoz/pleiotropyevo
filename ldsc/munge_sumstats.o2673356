Interpreting column names as follows:
N_obs:	Sample size
SNPID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
PVAL:	p-Value
BETA:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
MAF:	Allele frequency
